# Trump_Tweet_Bot
A mostly for fun practice with text generation, currently based off of Donald Trump's tweets as of March 22, 2017

I mostly used this guide as a basis in writing the code: http://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/

Libraries used:

-Keras

-numpy

-pandas

-Tensorflow as backend

I will post some results at a later date. (Currently training for better results)


Note: The "{" character is being used for padding and can be thought of as not being anything as far as results are concerned.
