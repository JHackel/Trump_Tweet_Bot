the us air force won the war in libya to clear the way for islamic extremist control of libya.
our worst threat to unemployment is @obamacare.  it will also destroy our country's basic standards.
when will our nation's sacrifices  be respectfully appreciated? iraq and libya should reimburse us in oil.
the debt is our nation's greatest threat. @barackobama is out of touch.
watch me tonight at 9pm et on @cnn, full hour. @piersmorgan won @apprenticenbc before taking over larry king's slot should be interesting.
why aren't we getting any oil from iraq before we leave? we are leaving the country wide open for iran. big mistake.
when will washington stand up to china. china is manipulating its currency and stealing our jobs. washington should move on legislation.
i am happy to see the majority of the gop candidates agree with me that the tax code must be simplified and the rates dropped.

we are leaving iraq after expending a tremendous amount of blood and treasure. we should be reimbursed with oil!  don't give it to iran.
the dollar is at an alltime wwii low against the yen. the fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation.
why do we continue to sit idly by while china steals our national security and corporate secrets? china is an enemy, not a friend.
the misery index is at a 28 year high.
why did @barackobama liberate libya and do nothing for the iranian protestors? iran is a threat to our national security.
a simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
why did we spend billions of our money on libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? what do we get out of this?
why is  crude oil priced at $86/barrel?  opec is  ripping us off. not worth $30/barrel.  america needs new leaders.

the s&p downgrade is a direct result of @barackobama's increased reckless budget spending and obama care. he owns this.

morning joe panel is stealing many of  my statements and ideas to better america without giving credit  the story of my life!
republicans gave obama a free pass to the white house  they just don't get it.
i believe america can be great only with proper leadership.
wake up america  china is eating our lunch.
all those politicians in washington and not one good negotiator.
why i would not have approved the deal... http//t.co/jgvl8fq #trumpvlog

the more you learn about the debt deal, the worse it gets.
your questions about my desk answered in today's #trumpvlog... http//t.co/ij01jh0
republicans and democrats have both created our economic problems.
why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? america must remain strong.
this is the best deal the republicans could get?
disappointed in gop and demsgiving obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
expresidential pollster pat cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.
we need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.
no taxes in boehner or reid planimportant victory for america.
watched sean hannity last night  a great guy.
if obama has to refight this fight next year he loses   "watch the fine details in every deal"  the art of the deal
blue ribbon commission to find and agree to future spending cuts? bad idea.
"never quit and always hit back"  the art of the comeback
i just got mike leach's new book,  swing your sword. he's a great coach, and he's written a great book. it's definitely worth reading.
i appreciate the kind words of mike huckabee, a fine american http//bit.ly/pebsgy
@barackobama has not released his own debt plan yet. he's totally lost, ineffective, desperate. gop has its best chance to make a great deal
my wife melania trump's show was a tremendous success last night. in case you missed her, you can see her again tonight on @qvc at 7 pm et
@johnboehner  "the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it."  the art of the deal
please tweet me your questions to answer in my #trumpvlog.
@karlrove's @crossroadsgps new ad criticizes obama for his excessive spending and debt, borrowing from china. didn't bush do the same thing?

people ask me every day to pose for pictures but the camera never works the first timethey are never prepared or maybe just very nervous!
"know when to walk away from the table."   the art of the deal
watch my wife melania trump tonight on @qvc at 1 a.m.  so proud of her!
higher taxes kill job creationcut wild government spending and waste.
china has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselvesus needs our toughest negotiatorand fast!
america's debt is greater than our gdp. time for new thinking.

my thoughts on the situation in norway and amanda knox... http//t.co/225oyhf #trumpvlog
fiscal mismanagement of cash costing us taxpayer billionscut fraud and waste before cutting funding for seniors.
obama, sadly, has no business or private sector backgroundand it shows.
the pressure on the debt ceiling is on @barackobama.... http//t.co/9gffifm #trumpvlog
the answer to both social security and medicare is a robust growing economynot cuts on the elderly.
we need a balanced budget amendment because congress has no fiscal discipline.
unfortunately@barackobama's continued attack on the us $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things
ronald kessler's new book "the secrets of the fbi" is a great book that should be read by everyone.
"increasing americas debt weakens us domestically and internationally."  us senator @barackobama, 2007
my interview on @gretawire last night   "our leaders are leading us into 'oblivion'" http//t.co/zogcrx3
"the gang of six"  yet another unmitigated disaster. any deal needs to repeal obamacare. tea.
"china is our enemythey want to destroy us"  redstate interview
obama is addicted to spending america into insolvency. his record proves it.
robust economic growth is the answer to the medicare problemnot cuts on the elderly.
while @barackobama seeks to further destroy  our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. such a total failureas a president.
@johnboehner  @ericcantor  "you can't con people...if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on."  the art of the deal
so china is ordering us to raise the debt limit...how low have we as a nation sunk?
the gop doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. defunding obamacare should be central to any deal.
every dollar @barackobama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from china on our children and grandchildren's backs. cutcapbalance!
@barackobama has sold guns to mexican drug lords while his doj erodes our 2nd  amendment rights.
#trumpvlog the republicans must act now, don't let @barackobama push you around.... http//t.co/phlzxon
congratulations to my daughter ivanka and her husband jared on the birth of  their daughter arabella rose yesterday.
@marcorubio is right. we need to create more taxpayers, not more taxes. cut, cap and balance.  http//t.co/8mkucg8

who will be the next @therealteenusa? find out this saturday at 8pm et on missteenusa.com  #teenusa
what is better advice "the art of the deal" or "rules for radicals"? i know which one @barackobama prefers.

@obama  iranian weapons killing americans in iraq? what are u doing about this?  http//t.co/pbnwzea
@johnboehner message for house gop  "the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it."  the art of the deal.
if only @obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening israel's borders then america would be on the path to solvency.
the art of the deal"the best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you have." cut, cap and balance.
republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @barackobama in today's debt talksfirst and foremost cut,cap and balance.
congress is back.time to cut, cap and balance.there is no revenue problem.the debt limit cannot be raised until obama spending is contained.
perhaps this is the kind of thinking we need in washington ... http//t.co/isqxbu1

president obama, please take the $5m check for charity tomorrow. it is so easy and could do so much good!

based on the ovation last night from the letterman @late_show audience, i believe it will be hard for obama to throw $5m down the drain....
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
another great charity that the $5m could go to just a recommendation to the pres.  the wounded warriors represented so well by @traceadkins
lots of response that obama should give the $5m to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in benghazi.
letterman @late_show was great last night. i had a lot of fun. you could see his audience really wanted obama to take the $ for charity.
"the dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants." the america we deserve
it is really a shame that barack obama may stop $5m from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.

...that it was hard not to end up rooting for trump..."
thank you to @dailytelegraph reviewer @neilmidgley who stated "'you've been trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters...
.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. i only wish mitt was more aggressive!
everyone is asking me to speak more on robert &amp kristen.i don't have time except to say "robert, drop her, she cheated on you &amp will again!"
last night was the first time obama said "we" instead of "i" in respect to bin laden's killing.
barack obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after bin laden now he wants all of the credit!
my announcement is tomorrow!
tomorrow i will be tweeting on only one subject!
china will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
mitt romney must start congratulating the navy seals and military on bin ladens killing, not the president.
.@mittromney should have been more aggressive last night. yet some polls have him winning the debate.

"casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent, from a director's point of view."  steven spielberg
no matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. he has kept obama in it, even with his terrible record.
i always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. by stopping, he gave his enemies an opening.
70% of the chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago http//t.co/pvppyf8l  at least someone has done well under obama.
the debate was pretty even but i thought mitt should have been much more aggressive on obama's failed foreign policy and i mean much more.
debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. viewership will be way down.
i will be doing @squawkcnbc at 730.
stop congratulating obama for killing bin laden. the navy seals killed bin laden. #debate
.@mittromney looks much calmer, and obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
bob schieffer will do a great job tonight. always treated me fairly.
well this is it, the final debate let's see how it goes. i'll be tweeting live.
former obama white house economic adviser @austan_goolsbee gave his old boss a 'c' on the economy http//t.co/6rzfgjmm  pretty generous!
why don't we ask the navy seals who killed bin laden? they don't seem to be happy with obama claiming credit. all he did is say o.k.
i look forward to @mittromney hitting obama hard tonight for lying about benghazi. cia told obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
everybody is asking about my announcement this wednesday concerning barack obamajust wait and see!
everyone knows i am right that robert pattinson should dump kristen stewart. in a couple of years, he will thank me. be smart, robert.
obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@mittromney has many openings to attack, especially when obama starts bragging about bin laden.
"this is my last election. after my election i have more flexibility." obama to @medvedevrussiae discussing our nuclear arsenal.
obama planted that @nytimes story on iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. he wants libya and china off the table.
the brass in #trump tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. i keep the atrium impeccable. key to its success!
.@toure i felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @piersmorgan. he drove you insane but, of course, piers is a lot smarter than you
my son don and his wife vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named spencer frederick very thrilling.
i wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
don't let obama play the iran card in order to start a war in order to get electedbe careful republicans!
.@toure, when you are fired from msnbc for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello.
autism rates through the roofwhy doesn't the obama administration do something about doctorinflicted autism. we lose nothing to try.

derek jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in trump world tower.
7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.real unemployment is at least 15%

when strasburg leaves @nationals for another team for more money, will washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?
bad sign for obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. their internals must be horrendous.

all the guys that said @mittromney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  mitt will remember the early helpers.
if obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally &amp aesthetically.
robert bryce @nypostcongrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp how destructive they are. windmills are a disaster.
remember, new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer. be careful the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.

my twitter has become so powerful that i can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
polls are starting to look really bad for obama. looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. don't put it past him!
obama did much better than he did last timebut still lost decisively.
do you believe barack hussein obama (aka barry soetoro) looked like a president last night? i don't!
obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. if we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
i still love derek, he is a winner!
remember, i said derek don't sell your trump world tower apartment...its been lucky for you. the day after he sold it, he broke his foot.
at the debate, the president kept talking of what he is going to do. i kept saying, why didn't he do it?  he lost me a long time ago.
verlander pitched great, but @yankees look truly defeated.
stupid george will gave @mittromney no chance 3 months ago. take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
george will said "best debate he ever saw". if you ever heard george will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
debate showed these guys really hate each other. at one point it looked like they would come to blows.
obama better than last time, but again, @mittromney wins. good night. #debate
you talk tough, mr. president, but have done nothing about china killing our jobs and economy.
such long rhetorical and boring answers from obama. no wonder nothing gets done.
.@mittromney much better on libya and middle east problems. obama has no answer.
obama keeps namedropping bill clinton he is no bill clinton.
obama weak on immigration. all words, no action. he's been prez 4 years.
obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @mittromney is looking strong and sharp.
obama just said @mittromney was "a very successful investor" big mistake for obama to admit he has less and less credibility.
obama keeps saying that he will do something but why hasn't he done it? it's all talk.
.@mittromney looks much stronger and much more presidential!
then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?

for political purposes only, obama is planning to hit libya for the benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
great win last night by peyton manning &amp @denver_broncos in san diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. very impressive.
if the @yankees can somehow beat verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. and i will go to games 6&amp 7 so they will win!

verlander is great but  very beatable. does not have a good era in playoff games
i turned down going to the debate tonight so that i could do live tweets to my many followers.
i have no doubt that mitt will do really well tonight. we'll all be watching @mittromney.

once again obama fails to classify china as a currency manipulator. he just helped china steal even more jobs and money from us.
arod should donate his contract to charity. he doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. he is a $30m/yr rip off.
looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @mittromney supporters at the intrepid. mitt's doing well.
barack obama is not who you think he is. most overrated politician in us history.
isn't it time that obama release his college records and applications? boy would that create a mess! he is not who you think.

arod is just not making it. we want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
obama will be trying very hard at next debate he doesn't want to lose the boeing.

a bad thing finally happened to derek jeter he is a great champion.
so much for washington shutting down strasburg they deserved to lose.
roadway steel on beautiful verrazanonarrows bridge is rusting and rotting away. scrape and paint before too late.
tonight, despite everything, put arod in the lineup.
everyone's wondering what's wrong with arod. not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore the real reason.
they found jessica in colorado body was mutilated death to the pervert killer.
joe girardi did a great job of managing the yankees this series.
i'll bet obama goes down just like washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
washington should have brought in strasburg to relieve they would have won.
when strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency washington will say " what were we doing".

now that obamas poll numbers are in tailspin  watch for him to launch a strike in libya or iran.  he is desperate.

in order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts, you need to know about real estate.  think like a billionaire

entrepreneurs put everything you've got into what you're doing. be totally focusednothing should be haphazard.
entrepreneurs whatever happens, you're responsible. if it doesn't happen, you're responsible.
entrepreneurs apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious. see yourself as victoriouswhich means never giving up.

that would mean that eliot spitzer has failed at everything he's donepolitics, tv &amp even real (cont) http//t.co/e92whibcbj
it will be interesting to see what happens to eliot spitzer if he loses the election for comptroller to very capable @scottmstringer.
i have just lost my beautiful &amp elegant long time exec. assistant  norma foerderer. she passed away yesterday  a truly magnificent woman.
again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack syria  if you do many very bad things will happen &amp from that fight the u.s. gets nothing!
"@gregfrech @realdonaldtrump have you seen the video of the rebel commander cutting out and eating the syrian soldiers heart &amp liver!!

.@alexsalmond is making a truly stupid mistake by forcing ugly industrial wind turbines down scotlands throat he's hated for it.

if fm @alexsalmond needs to litter scotland w/ ugly industrial wind turbines to gain independence, he will lose! http//t.co/tqkkcly4vl
fact  the reason why americans have to worry about a government shutdown is because obama refuses to pass a budget.

i know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually i'm a very compassionate person (with a very high iq) with strong common sense
didn't the boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?  we are not dealing with an innocent baby heredeath
when the stupid people start feeling sorry for the boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killingsmaimings
i hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the boston killer as "the suspect".
the shirts and ties at macy's are so goodbeautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piecel kicked his ass

i hope everyone, or rather almost everyone, had a great easter! we need our leaders to make great and wise decisions in these troubled times
so, what will happen to the big o on celebrity apprentice tonight. remember, i only fire people when it is deserved, not for other reasons!
big night on celebrity apprentice tonight. important, starts at 10 p.m. as scheduled but nbc just increased all future episodes to 2 hours!

no, i'm saying that the world is paying the price for china's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories! very sad.
"@kimstagliano @realdonaldtrump when will nyt write about vaccine damage and its price? 3 girls w autism here, mr. trump." they should kim!
major article in new york times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in china and how it is rapidly growng! rest of world pays.
china is the biggest environmental polluter in the world, by far. they do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!
we have tremendous economic power over china if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't! china's economy would collapse without us.
"@sullythinks why is @realdonaldtrump not the president of the us right now?!" a very good question!
"@thejbrain @realdonaldtrump very well said. the united states needs people like you to show what truly leadership means!" so true!
"@kaiser1859 @realdonaldtrump what is the solution mr trump?" leadership!
what do we get from our economic competitor south korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from north korea?  nothing!
north korea is reliant on china. china could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.

find out who and what is the best in your field. identify the trendsetters, leaders and authorities. learn the standards they follow.
achievers go for the challenge, so the next deal is what they're thinking about. they have an obligation to best themselves.
wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge. it's something you can't teach someone elseyou have to achieve it on your own.

haters, stop saying i went bankrupt, it is not so. i never went bankrupt...
... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.
for the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, i have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals.
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
... icahn, kravis, apollo and most othersbut nobody says they went bankrupt!
people buy deals &amp immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals...
... it is very effective and a commonly used business tool.
why do the losers &amp haters always say i wear a wig when they know i dont.  like it or not, its all minejust ask barbara walters.
@martinfagervik  win!

according to new employment numbers, 296,000 americans have dropped out of the work force &amp gave up looking for work.

let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.john f. kennedy, inaugural address, january 1961
the losing team is now back in boardroom. i can't discuss the team members or what's going on or what happens from here on out.
re my hairshould i change it? what do you think?
it's true... dennis is really into thisvery animated. i have never seen him this way before.
which team is your favorite?
re omarosa nasty, tough or smart...or all?
does anyone agree with marilu that gary, while 'adorable', is a distraction?
omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept &amp presentation.
next she says she's being set up by omarosa to fail....is somebody confused?
what?!  latoya is saying omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?
on the whole, the teams seem to be working well together. no wars...yet.
gary as the cat in the hat? he can work it out.
what do you think of gary's definition of    fun?
trace delivers check to hospital in nyc  american red cross must be grateful to trace and his team for their tremendous work.
honest omarosa she won't backstabshe'll come at you from the front.
which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
my 757 is incrediblei think the teams agree on that.
will team power be able to withstand omarosa as pm? smooth sailing is not expected.
will plan b miss trace?
firing bret was a tough one for mebut omarosa doesn't seem to mind.
omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...
trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $.  looks like a good season for charities.
there's definitely no love lost between piers and omarosa.
bret had a target on his back from the get go...
that was some episode last weekwe've got a great cast!
i will be live tweeting during the @apprenticenbc tonight at 9pm et.
i'm at trump doral right now, tiger will tee off shortly.

i will be on @latenightjimmy tonight.  always have a good time with @jimmyfallon.  now we know he will get high ratings tonight.
one of the reasons, i assume, i was inducted into the @wwe hall of fame is that vince mcmahon and i have the all time highest ratings...
... and pay per view records with battle of the billionaires in detroit. it was a wild day!
it is a great honor for me to be inducted into the @wwe hall of fame. this will take place on april 6...
... at madison square garden followed by a ceremony with 80,000 people at metlife stadium, wrestlemania.
thanks go angelo, people are now really aware of my ties, shirts, and cuff links at macy's

when employees are working at home they can never have the same cohesivness as working together as a group...
... also, if theyre at home who the hell knows what theyre doing (a second job maybe).

.@marissamayer is right to expect yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs. working at home. she is doing a great job!
an individual, whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns, has turned his attention to me.....
...so far, he has been a complete failure at doing so. he should read the art of the deal and use his energy to focus on a new career.
the media is so in the tank for obama that it is amazingthe funny thing is, he cant stand them!
speaker john boehner, who i like, should never have agreed to raise taxes because the republicans got absolutely nothing for it!
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
people buy deals &amp immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals..
.... it is a very effective &amp commonly used business tool.
@roxannequintana  thanks roxanne.

i'm saying that the tea party, perhaps by another name, will soon have another big moment and will be a major factor in victory!
why didn't movie lincoln use ford's theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater?

who is the moron who decided to release the ferguson grand jury findings after 900 o'clock in the evening. what were they thinking?
our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in washington, you can expect ferguson type riots and looting in other places
sadly, because president obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!
as china and the rest of the world continue to rip off the u.s. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in ferguson!
can you imagine what putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the u.s. as they watch the ferguson riot
if the decision by the grand jury in ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now!
despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.if obama were a  leader, this would not be the case

iran and the united states just pushed deadline back seven months on working out a nuclear deal. iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
isis is starting its own currency. may be stronger than the dollar if obamacare is fully implemented.
there is no excuse for riots in ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
fact  amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.

entrepreneurs do not view any failure as the final say for your efforts. learn your lessons quickly, then move on.
entrepreneurs  see yourself as victorious look at the solution, not the problem.
entrepreneurs never give up. be tough. apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious.
entrepreneurs keep the big picture in mind. there are always opportunities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
entrepreneurs  put everything you've got into what you're doing. know  exactly what you want and go for it.  nothing should be haphazard.

some great quotes from the legendary and courageous winston churchill "never, never, never give up." ...
if youve looked over the years,ive been right on virtually every issue from iraq (not going in but if so taking the oil) to jobs to china
by obama mentioning manhattan yesterday in his response, he has singlehandedly made it target #1. how totally stupid is this guy?
"@wesbart53 watched his speech yesterday...pathetic. carteresque, weak. his delivery is so cautious not to offend, absolutely zero"  true!
this is the time for the united states to be strengthening all important military components  not rolling over and dealing from weakness!
not good or smart for obama to be calling russia a "regional" power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in nyc.
president obama looks absolutely exhausted in the netherlands. he is not a natural leader, was never ment to lead  it is tough work for him

obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off air force one.  doesnt look presidential and at some point he will take a fall.
i wonder if apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iphone. i hear they will be doing it soonlong overdue.
obama must now focus, get his mind off "march.madness", and lead! watch russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of obamacare!
the situation with russia is much more dangerous than most people may think  and could lead to world war iii. we need great leadership fast
we should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. must be very strong to prosper &amp survive
i believe putin will continue to rebuild the russian empire. he has zero respect for obama or the u.s.!
putin has become a big hero in russia with an all time high popularity. obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. sad

president obama, be cool, be smart, be sharp and focus (no more march madness), and you can beat putin at his own game. it can be done!
while putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the world, president obama is watching march madness (basketball)!
i don't hate obama at all, i just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history!
we're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly chinese passengers, and that's okbut how much are russia &amp china spending?

it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media.  new @cnn poll amazing in all categories. 21 pt. lead
why does @foxnews give @karlrove so much airtime. he (and other fox pundits) is so biased. still thinks romney won. unfair coverage of trump
.@foxnews treats me so badly. using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out @cnn poll. all negative!
the @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. bad
the silent majority is silent no more! remember the importance of voting!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016 https//t.co/wbdsg5ab25
the hillary clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. be careful hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.

big news just out  new @cnn poll  trump  39 and leads in every major category. likeability way up. cruz 18  carson 10  rubio 10
we need a president with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!
it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. sad!
when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama, it meant got beaten badly. the media knows this. often used word in politics!
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016 https//t.co/tudwrg6rsd
wow, new reuters poll just out. big lead if you want to make america great again!  trump 37  cruz 11 this is at the top of drudge!
for those on tv defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc #msm is giving it false meaningtell them it means beaten badly. dishonest #msm
npr's @nealconan said "schlonged" to wapo re 1984 mondale/ferraro campaign "that ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #hypocrisy
once again, #msm is dishonest. "schlonged" is not vulgar. when i said hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.
jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering jeb's statements. he is really pathetic!

why doesn't @jebbush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate?
will @jebbush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?

kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in new hampshire and his numbers have gone down. people from nh are smart!
watch kasich squirm  if he is not truthful in his negative ads i will sue him just for fun!
i want to do negative ads on john kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that i dont want to waste my money.
john kasich, despite being governor of ohio, is losing to me in the ohio polls. pathetic!
john kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.
governor kasich, whose failed campaign &amp debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive  story on my speech in alabama last night. it was a great evening!
i had 15,000 people in phoenix but @politico said "the rooms capacity is just over 2000." but said bernie  sanders had 11,000 in same room.
.@politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source, and that is saying something. they go out of their way to distort truth!

congrats to the new gov. of texas, @gregabbott_tx, for taking a tough &amp bold stance at the border. should have been done long ago by perry.
i have a proven track record supporting our veterans. veterans deserve universal access to care. va scandal proves politicians are inept.
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
it's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans.....
i will make this right for our great vets!
all he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything.
....john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives.
the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes!

....likewise, billions of dollars gets brought into mexico    through the border. we get the killers, drugs &amp crime, they get the money!
el chapo and the mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a  vacuum cleaner, sucking drugs and death right into the u.s.
the u.s. will invite el chapo, the mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a u.s. citizen because our "leaders" can't say no!
.....but that's what i've been saying. very unfair treatment by the media!
now that the mexican drug lord escaped from prison, everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc. coming into the u.s. comes over border!

entrepreneurs focus on your goals, not on fixed patterns. do what's necessary and what's unnecessary will be made clear.
entrepreneurs dont sell yourself short. dont ever think youve done it all already or that youve done your best.
entrepreneurs keep your eyes on your ideals as well as reality. accentuate the positive without being blind to the negative.

the best social program, by far, is a job! our jobs are being taken away from us by china and many other countries  incompetent leader.
president obama, you have a big job to do. go to baltimore and bring both sides together. with proper leadership, it can be done! do it.
our country has to come together. we have to start working with, and really liking,  each other. the whole world is watching baltimore.
"@vanderpunked can we drop @realdonaldtrump off in the middle of #baltimore so he can show obama how it's done?" i would fix it fast!
the mayor of baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters "space to destroy"  another real genius!
now that the ineffective baltimore  police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the u.s. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?
our great african american president hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying baltimore!
blatant and rampant property destruction in baltimore as the police stand by and watch. should be a lesson on how not to handle riots. sad!

china has a backdoor into the transpacific partnership. this deal does not address currency manipulation. china is laughing at us.
the transpacific partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. do not pass it.
republicans should not be giving obama fast track authority on trade. the transpacific partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector

entrepreneurs be tough, be smart, be personable, but dont take things personally. thats good business.
entrepreneurs dont ever think youve done it all already or that youve done your best. you haven't so don't limit yourself!
entrepreneurs  follow your instincts and keep your focus intact. you alone know where you really want to go.
entrepreneurs paying attention can be a cost effective way of protecting yourself.
entrepreneurs look at the solution, not the problem. learn to focus on what will give results.
entrepreneurs keep your momentum. without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
entrepreneurs keep the big picture in mind. there are always opportunities &amp possibilities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them

slaughter you. this is a purely religious threat, which turned into reality. such hatred! when will the u.s., and all countries, fight back?

i met some really great air force generals and navy admirals today, talking about airplane capability and pricing. very impressive people!
i have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that i spent far less money on the win than hillary on the loss!
i would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote  but would campaign differently
campaigning to win the electoral college is much more difficult &amp sophisticated than the popular vote. hillary focused on the wrong states!
yes, it is true  carlos slim, the great businessman from mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting. we met, he is a great guy!
especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). they focused on wrong states
bill clinton stated that i called him after the election. wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). he "doesn't know much" ...
"@mike_pence congratulations to @realdonaldtrump officially elected president of the united states today by the electoral college!"

we did it! thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).
today there were terror attacks in turkey, switzerland and germany  and it is only getting worse. the civilized world must change thinking!

the seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
hillary clinton just had her 47% moment. what a terrible thing she said about so many great americans!
while hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, i still respect them all!
really sad that republicans would allow themselves to be used in a clinton ad. lindsey graham, romney, flake, sass. supreme court, remember!
wow, hillary clinton was so insulting to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. i think it will cost her at the polls!

lyin' hillary clinton told the fbi that she did not know the "c" markings on documents stood for classified. how can this be happening?
to the africanamerican community the democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. i will fix it, vote "t"
the polls are close so crooked hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.why did she hammer 13 devices and acidwash emails?
the great state of arizona, where i just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective senator, jeff flake. sad!
the republican party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @jeffflake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
"@annebellar @realdonaldtrump @cnn cnn is so biased. never ever watch them. trump 2016!!"
crooked hillary's v.p. pick said this morning that i was not aware that russia took over crimea. a total lie  and taken over during o term!
wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on crooked's fbi release. they are at the back of the pack  no longer a credible source

certain republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the u.s.supreme court get proper appointments. sad!
"stay on message" is the chant. i always do  trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd a, repeal ocare, borders, etc  but media misrepresents!
i have always been the same personremain true to self.the media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
it is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
i am not only fighting crooked hillary, i am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. people get it!
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media. she is not a talented person or politician. the dishonest media refuses to expose!
my rallies are not covered properly by the media. they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
if the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words i say, i would be beating hillary by 20%
the failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that i am saying to advisers that i will change. false, i am who i amnever said
the failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. their reporting is fiction. the media protects hillary!
"@zulu_out you are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #makeamericagreatagain #usa loves u" thanks
"@pauladuvall2 we're all enjoying you, as well, mr. t.! you've inspired hope and a positive spirit throughout america! god bless you!" nice
"@need2knowu  @willspeakout yes you are my hero i admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for america!!!"
we now have confirmation as to one reason crooked h wanted to be sure that nobody saw her emails  payforplay. how can she run for pres.
"@willspeakout thank you for all that you are doing for us! you campaign endlessly and have spent millions.we love you! #trumptrain" thanks
i am truly enjoying myself while running for president. the people of our country are amazing  great numbers on november 8th!

will cnn send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding  or are they worried it will hurt hillary?
when will we see stories from cnn on clinton foundation corruption and hillary's payforplay at state department?
cnn anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
cnn will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for hillary clinton.

crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke. @cnn and the little watched @morning_joe  sad!
no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton  corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
hillary's wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction, terrorism and isis across the world.
hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
hillary will never reform wall street. she is owned by wall street!
our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
hillary's refusal to mention radical islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

a vote for clintonkaine is a vote for tpp, nafta, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.

not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complainingthen a small one. pathetic
our not very bright vice president, joe biden, just stated that i wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. sorry joe, that was ted cruz!
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. the danger is massive. no!
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. get tough!
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. no recognition  sad!
funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said "trump is a genius." america 1st!
as i have been saying, crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election, despite her statements to the contrary top adv.
just like i have warned from the beginning, crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp. https//t.co/eontwk6i8y
many of bernie's supporters have left the arena. did bernie go home and go to sleep?
i hate to say it, but the republican convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the democratic convention!
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. highly overrated!
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is, and neither does isis (a good thing). please get your facts straight  thanks. @megynkelly

dems don't want to talk isis b/c hillary's foreign interventions unleashed isis &amp her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

pocahontas bombed last night! sad to watch.
why aren't the democrats speaking about isis, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. the republican convention was great
funny, if you listen to @foxnews, the democrats did not have a good day. if you listen to the other two, they are fawning. what a difference
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton. all of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! waste of time.
elizabeth warren, often referred to as pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary, who she always hated!
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution. we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party, they have no future! i know more about cory than he knows about himself.
i was at @foxnews and met juan williams in passing.  he asked if he could have pictures taken with me. i said fine. he then trashes on air!
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold. he got nothing for all of the time, energy and money. the v.p. a joke!
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
clinton betrayed bernie voters. kaine supports tpp, is in pocket of wall street, and backed iraq war.

great poll numbers are coming out all over. people don't want another four years of obama, and crooked hillary would be even worse. #maga
the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change!
wow, the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess. but fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
here we go again with another clinton scandal, and emails yet (can you believe). crooked hillary knew the fix was in, b never had a chance!
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the dnc  they just got caught, that's all! they laughed at bernie.
if bernie sanders, after seeing the just released emails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
thank you! #makeamericagreatagain https//t.co/pzs9uwgzam
hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb emails, using even religion, against bernie!
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc emails, which should never have been written (stupid), because putin likes me
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes. no way they are going to fix america's problems. isis &amp all others laughing!
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. thank you!
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory, she's out!
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! emails say the rigged system is alive &amp well!
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength, i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook!
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, dws. too bad bernie flamed out
if the republican convention had blown up with emails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (bernie), media would go wild
the @cnn panels are so one sided, almost all against trump. @foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. don't watch cnn!
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated. the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
today proves what i have always known, that @reince priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not debbie wasserman shultz (@dwstweets.)
sorry folks, but bernie sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. he is trying to dismiss the new emails and dnc disrespect. sad!
there is no longer a bernie sanders "political revolution." he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates.
looks like the bernie people will fight. if not, their blood, sweat and tears was a total waste of time. kaine stands for opposite!
wow, president obama's brother, malik, just announced that he is voting for me. was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else!
bernie sanders started off strong, but with the selection of kaine for v.p., is ending really weak. so much for a movement! total disrespect
the crooked hillary v.p. choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters. just another case of bad judgement by h!

thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night. from the heart!
the wikileaks email release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together. isis and our other enemies are drooling. they don't look presidential to me!
i will bring jobs back and get wages up. people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. clinton killed jobs!
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. job killer!
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. i will bring jobs back!
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania. against steelworkers and miners. husband signed nafta.
leaked emails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders. mock his heritage and much more. online from wikileakes, really vicious. rigged
pocahontas wanted v.p. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate. also, crooked hillary hates her!
tim kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. bernie fought for nothing!
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine, who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for. philly fight?

convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. let today be devoted to crooked hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
i have over seven million hits on social media re crooked hillary clinton. check it out sleepy eyes, @markhalperin @nbcpolitics
sleepy eyes chuck todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.he could not have watched my standing ovation speech in n.c.
even the once great caesars is bankrupt in a.c. others to follow. ask the democrat city council what happened to atlantic city.
hillary clinton should ask why the democrat pols in atlantic city made all the wrong moves  convention center, airport  and destroyed city
i made a lot of money in atlantic city and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
crooked hillary clinton lied to the fbi and to the people of our country. she is sooooo guilty. but watch, her time will come!
the rigged system may have helped hillary clinton escape criminal charges, but...https//t.co/ko64iamdgj https//t.co/8cbsfnpl2l
crooked hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
crooked hillary clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." not fit!
crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the u.s. her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. bad judgement!
i don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with "murder." come november 8, she's out!
raised a lot of money for the republican party. there will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. lots of support! win
i will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 11pm. enjoy!
my son, @erictrump will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on @foxnews. enjoy!
looking forward to meeting with @senbobcorker in a little while. we will be traveling to north carolina together today.
fbi director said crooked hillary compromised our national security. no charges. wow! #riggedsystem
the system is rigged. general petraeus got in trouble for far less. very very unfair! as usual, bad judgment.
it was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. she has done a fantastic job for the people of iowa and u.s. will see her again!
taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of air force one on the campaign trail by president obama and crooked hillary. a total disgrace!
on @foxnews at 700 p.m. "special meet the trumps" hope you enjoy!
why is president obama allowed to use air force one on the campaign trail with crooked hillary? she is flying with him tomorrow. who pays?
with hillary and obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is  radical islam!
crooked hillary clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! where are the 33,000 missing emails?
the only people who are not interested in being the v.p. pick are the people who have not been asked!
i look forward to meeting @joniernst today in new jersey. she has done a great job as senator of iowa!
spent time with indiana governor mike pence and family yesterday. very impressed, great people!
senator tom cotton was great on meet the press yesterday. despite a totally onesided interview by chuck todd, the end result was solid!
dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star, or plain star!
happy 4th of july! #trump2016 #americafirst https//t.co/ndb3aqrlty https//t.co/yhhyqjwjw6
crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis  it will just go on forever. we need change!
the third mass attack (slaughter) in days by isis. 200 dead in baghdad, worst in many years. we do not have leadership that can stop this!
in bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran. 20 were killed!
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the u.s.a.g. so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught!
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting "go away, no pictures."
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
"the system is rigged!"
on saturday a great man, elie wiesel, passed away.the world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the u.s.a.g. to work out a deal. the system is totally rigged &amp corrupt!
only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know.
just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd, and the entire show, is against me.the good newsthe people get it!
it was just announcedby sourcesthat no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton. like i said, the system is totally rigged!
it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton. what she did was wrong! what bill did was stupid!

.@traceadkins great job on fox this morning. keep up the good work!
take a look at what happened w/ bill clinton. the system is totally rigged. does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
bill clinton's meeting was a total secret. nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
as bernie sanders said, hillary clinton has bad judgement. bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by hillary!

i will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on fox! enjoy!
the reason i put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, i want to make america great again!
i have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. i have totally terminated the loan!
the very dishonest @nbcnews refuses to accept the fact that i have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. done deal!
one of the reasons hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich selling out america. https//t.co/mo9qrmyxrd

why would the uschamber be upset by the fact that i want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that i want penalties for cheaters?
the @uschamber must fight harder for the american worker. china, and many others, are taking advantage of u.s. with our terrible trade pacts
iron mike tyson was not asked to speak at the convention though i'm sure he would do a good job if he was. the media makes everything up!
"@jtsbk  @allenwest thanks for sharing eric we need @realdonaldtrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe"
we must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the united states.
yet another terrorist attack, this time in turkey. willthe world ever realize what is going on? so sad.
hillary clintons presidency would be catastrophic forthe future of our country. she is illfit with bad judgment.
benghazi is just another hillary clinton failure. it justnever seems to work the way it's supposed to with clinton.

the media is unrelenting. they will only go with and report a story in a negative light. i called brexit (hillary was wrong), watch november
crooked hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the u.s. senate, goofy elizabeth warren, who lied on heritage.

clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on brexit with big dollar ads. disgraceful!
crooked hillary clinton, who called brexit 100% wrong (along with obama), is now spending wall street money on an ad on my correct call.
george will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the republican party.he's made many bad calls

crooked hillary clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. obama plus!

crooked hillary is being badly criticized (for a wall street paid for ad) by politifact for a false ad on me on women. she is a total fraud!
crooked hillary clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
just like i have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. we can be great!
people like @katyturnbc report on my campaign, but have zero access. they say what they want without any knowledge.true of so much of media!

crooked hillary clinton wants completely open borders. millions of democrats will run from her over this and support me.
just met with courageous family of sarah root in nebraska. sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
goofy elizabeth warren, hillary clintons flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. she is not native american.

on the way to the great state of rhode island big rally. then to pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
kasich just announced that he wants the people of indiana to vote for him. typical politician  can't make a deal work.
shows how weak and desperate lyin' ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
lyin' ted cruz and 1 for 38 kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. shows weakness!
lyin' ted and kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. their donors &amp special interest groups are not happy with them. sad!
wow, just announced that lyin' ted and kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the republican nomination. desperation!
i am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. it is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. becoming irrelevant!

i met prince on numerous occasions. he was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. he will be greatly missed!
cruz said kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. now he can't get to 1237. drop out lyin' ted.
both ted cruz and john kasich have no path to victory. they should both drop out of the race so that the republican party can unify!
senator ted cruz has been mathematically eliminated from race. he said kasich should get out for same reason. i think both should get out!

kasich only looks o.k. in polls against hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed zero negative ads against him

crooked hillary clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. i am the one person she doesn't want to run against. will be such fun!
lyin' ted cruz can't get votes (i am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the republican bosses. it won't work!
lyin' ted cruz will never be able to beat hillary. despite a rigged delegate system, i am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

dr. ben carson blasted ted cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies."
cruz just lied again i am, and have been totally against #obamacare repeal and replace!
the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud!
this was sent out from ted cruz as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #cruzfraud https//t.co/trm7kucrsu
i will be interviewed on @greta at 700 p.m. enjoy! @foxnews
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus, either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified.
and finally, cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and "choice"  a total lie!
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of f) and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz. fraud
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud. also, cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters.
during primetime of the iowa caucus, cruz put out a release that @realbencarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for cruz.
ted cruz didn't win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad!
great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. we said no and she went hostile. a real dummy! @cnn

i will be talking about my wonderful experience in iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the medialater in new hampshire. big crowd
the media has not covered my longshot great finish in iowa fairly. brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
because i was told i could not do well in iowa, i spent very little there  a fraction of cruz &amp rubio. came in a strong second. great honor
my experience in iowa was a great one. i started out with all of the experts saying i couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. nice

by not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, i was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness"  while raising $6,000,000 for vets.
wow, just saw an ad  cruz is lying on so many levels. there is nobody more against obamacare than me, will repeal &amp replace. he lies!
ted cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important financial disclosure form. very low interest loans, scam!
ted cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in canada). will loose big to hillary. polls show i beat hillary easily! win!

amazing that ted cruz can't even get a senator like @bensasse, who is easy, to endorse him. not one senator  is endorsing canada ted!
.@bensasse looks more like a gym rat than a u.s. senator. how the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta
the great state of nebraska can do much better than @bensasse as your senator. saw him on @greta  totally ineffective. wants paid for pols.

great new numbers. thank you! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016https//t.co/z1lqdxqvrl https//t.co/gfynuwwcyn
ted cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. they own him!
based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a "natural born canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from c banks?
oh no, just reported that ted cruz didn't report another loan, this one from citi. wow, no wonder banks do so well in the u.s. senate.
the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace. remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file. goldman sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. not much of a reformer!
ted cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a canadian citizen. he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million $ loan papers.not believable
ted cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen until 15 months ago. lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. i told you so
more radical islam attacks today  it never ends! strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. no more being politically correct.

this is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. i said it should not be allowed and abc agreed.

on international women's day, join me in honoring the critical role of women here in america &amp around the world.
i have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy.
i feel sure that my friend @randpaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows obamacare is a disaster!
don't let the fake news tell you that there is big infighting in the trump admin. we are getting along great, and getting major things done!
i am working on a new system where there will be competition in the drug industry. pricing for the american people will come way down!
don't worry, getting rid of state lines, which will promote competition, will be in phase 2 &amp 3 of healthcare rollout. @foxandfriends
for eight years russia "ran over" president obama, got stronger and stronger, pickedoff crimea and added missiles. weak! @foxandfriends
our wonderful new healthcare bill is now out for review and negotiation. obamacare is a complete and total disaster  is imploding fast!
122 vicious prisoners, released by the obama administration from gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. just another terrible decision!

who was it that secretly said to russian president, "tell vladimir that after the election i'll have more flexibility?" @foxandfriends
is it true the dnc would not allow the fbi access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? can that be possible?
arnold schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. sad end to great show
how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. this is nixon/watergate. bad (or sick) guy!
i'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that president obama was tapping my phones in october, just prior to election!
is it legal for a sitting president to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? turned down by court earlier. a new low!
just out the same russian ambassador that met jeff sessions visited the obama white house 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.
terrible! just found out that obama had my "wires tapped" in trump tower just before the victory. nothing found. this is mccarthyism!
the first meeting jeff sessions had with the russian amb was set up by the obama administration under education program for 100 ambs......

after being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the fake news @nytimes is still lost!
